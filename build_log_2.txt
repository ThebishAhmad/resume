⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\hpp\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.

Type error: Could not find a declaration file for module 'gsap-trial/SplitText'. 'C:/Users/hpp/Desktop/Goding/Portfolio/node_modules/gsap-trial/SplitText.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/gsap-trial` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'gsap-trial/SplitText';`
